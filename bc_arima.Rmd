```{r bitcoin}
data <- read.csv("data/BTC-USD.csv", sep=",")
summary(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
